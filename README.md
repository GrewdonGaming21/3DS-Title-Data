# 3DS-Titles-Database

Thank you for looking at my database

**This is an Anti-piracy Database, you will not find roms here that aren't system apps' `.cia` file**

**`GameBoy Advance Virtual Console`** **`.code`** files are just the original **`.gba`** file.

The **`.code`** files were extracted with [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9)

The **`.tik`** files were extracted with [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP)
